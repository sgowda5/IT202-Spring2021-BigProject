User Feedback:

I really like your Police Dress page.
I feel that you can add some information about yourself so the users can know more about you.
I think you can put your NASA images in the middle of the screen. It will look better.


How I addressed the user feedback:
I added an about me page so that the users get to know me better.
I centered the image in the NASA page.
I also added styling to the overall application.
